## Making changes

The markdown files (and style files) can be edited and submitted via a PR. When the PR is merged, a GH Action builds and published the new site.

## Local development

The site is build using a little Python script in `makesite.py`. Just run it and then open `./output/index.html` in your browser to check the result.
