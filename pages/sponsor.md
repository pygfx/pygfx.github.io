# Sponsoring Pygfx


## üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Keep Pygfx independent and active

Maintaining and growing wgpu and Pygfx costs time and dedication. We rely on sponsors to maintain (and grow) the project further.
If you represent a company / group that relies on Pygfx or wgpu-pu, we kindly ask for a sponsorship. That way we can keep replying to issues, review pull request, and move Pygfx further.


## üéÅ What you get

* Most importantly, sponsors help ensure that Pygfx is actively maintained!
* Sponsors also get priority on bug reports and feature requests.
* An honorable mention on the front page of pygfx.org!
* In the top tiers, one-on-one support to help you use Pygfx to the max.

We employ a few different [sponsorship tiers](https://github.com/sponsors/pygfx).
