# Sponsoring Pygfx


## üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Keep pygfx independent and active

Maintaining and growing wgpu and pygfx costs time and dedication. We rely on sponsors to maintain (and grow) the project further.
If you represent a company / group that relies on pygfx or wgpu-pu, we kindly ask for a sponsorship. That way we can keep replying to issues, review pull request, and move pygfx further.


## üéÅ What you get

* Most importantly, sponsors help ensure that pygfx is actively maintained!
* Sponsors also get priority on bug reports and feature requests.
* An honorable mention on the front page of pygfx.org!
* In the top tiers, one-on-one support to help you use Pygfx to the max.

We employ a few different [sponsorship tiers](https://github.com/sponsors/pygfx).

If we receive more funds than we can spend, the surplus acts as a buffer to create runway. If that buffer becomes large enough we plan to onboard additional developers.
