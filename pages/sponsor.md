# Sponsoring / support contracts


## <i class='fas'></i> Keep Pygfx going

Maintaining and growing wgpu and Pygfx costs time and dedication. We rely on sponsors to maintain (and grow) the project further.
If you represent a company / group that relies on Pygfx or wgpu-pu, please consider a sponsorship to help move Pygfx further, and get the support that you need.

As a sponsor you don't pay for *using* Pygfx, you pay for its continued growth. And by contributing together, Pygfx stays independent, in the spirit of Open Source collaboration.


## <i class='fas'></i> How funds are used

Funds for Pygfx are primarily used to fund our developer time. This includes the work on Pygfx itself, keeping wgpu-py up-to-date with the development of WebGPU, and maintaining other dependencies like the render canvas.
Surplus funds are used as a buffer (to create some runway), onboarding additional developers, and maybe organize an event.


## <i class='fas'></i> What you get

A sponsorship represents a support contract that offers the following benefits:

* Ongoing development of the project.
* Priority on bug reports and feature requests.
* Company logo on the front page of pygfx.org.
* In the top tiers: in-person support to help you use Pygfx to the max.
